- Java follows the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" principle, meaning it can run on various platforms with a compatible JVM.
- It's a fully object-oriented language, where everything is an object, even primitive data types.
- Java employs automatic garbage collection to manage memory by reclaiming unused memory.
- It's commonly used for enterprise applications, web development, and large-scale systems.
- Java is strongly typed, requiring variable types to be declared before use.
- The language boasts an extensive ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools thanks to its active community.
- Java code is compiled into bytecode and executed on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for platform independence.
- It was popular for Android app development until Kotlin emerged as a competitor.
- Java introduced functional programming features like lambdas and streams in Java 8.
- Security features include class loaders, bytecode verification, and runtime security checks.
- Java consistently ranks among the top programming languages in popularity.
- It supports multi-threading and concurrency for parallel processing.
- Java doesn't have explicit pointers, which helps avoid certain memory-related issues.
- Enums and annotations are used to represent constants and add metadata to code.
- Checked exceptions ensure handling of errors at compile time.
- Java applets were once common for interactive web content but have declined due to security concerns.
- The language continues to evolve with new features and improvements in each version.
- Java was created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems.
- Java's standardization is maintained through the Java Community Process (JCP).
- Open-source libraries and frameworks contribute to Java's extensive ecosystem.
